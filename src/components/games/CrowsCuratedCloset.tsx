                    At its core, this game is about creative freedom. Design and decorate your boutique exactly the way you want - from soft, cozy arrangements to bold gothic aesthetics. Place furniture, organize shelves, and shape your layout to create an inviting and efficient shopping space. As your store grows, you’ll unlock new styles, items, and decorative options, allowing your boutique to evolve alongside your strategy. Cater to different customer preferences, refine your product selection, and optimise your setup to maximise profit. To keep up with demand, you’ll build a growing team of cats who take over tasks around the shop. While they handle the day-to-day work, you can focus on expansion, design, and turning your boutique into a profitable, ever-expanding business.
